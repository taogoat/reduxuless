Naive JS emulation of CSS Modules, React, and Redux

I just want to learn better Javascript

This is an attempt to emulate some current design patterns using only basic JS.

+Project constraints:
  +functional programming, no classes 
  +method names create descriptions of actions resulting in readable code 
  +functional document/component names describe module tree 
  +javascript only, no css or html files 
  +no external client
  +side dependencies 
  +no more than 50 lines per file 
  +no more than 3 indentations 
  +styles stored as css.js 
  +html stored as html.js 
  +modules self-descibe and drag/drop into layout framework 
  +modules self-describe and drag/drop into state/data framework
